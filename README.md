This is an adaptation of [danielcs88's adaptation](https://github.com/danielcs88/SQL-Murder-Mystery) of the Northwestern University Knight Lab's [SQL
Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/).

The solutionPandas.py avoids use of sql within Python. .merge has been used in a few places.
An [interactive H5P to accompany the activity](https://h5p.org/node/1399489) is available
